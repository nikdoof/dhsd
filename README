DHSD v0.01 Beta
---------------

DHSD is a dynamic update engine for the dhs.org dynamic dns service.
The aim is to provide a quick and efficent update engine that will
monitor selected network devices and check for changes of the IP address.

PLEASE NOTE, this is a CVS BETA release (in other words...half working)
i have put this code onto the CVS for users to take a look at and see
how it works.

Thanks go to:

	* Sourceforge for hosting my project
	* Dyfet for his pdetach() code
        * DFX for his dprintf() code
        * Peter Mac Millan for his base64.c
